parallel-colt-matrix
====================

Basic implementation of parallel colt in clojure

What to do:

This is how I was planning to continue the project, however now I don't have much time, so...

The broadcast function is definitely the next thing to do, PC manage matrix up to 3 dimension so broadcast is necessary only for vector and matrix 2D
Then is neccesary to think again about map, especcially for more than 2 argument, I would think that is good idea to write a map that works with the as/to-element-seq.
Finally I should implemented the 3D matrix that should not be very difficult.

Obviously I am writting this for anybody who want to continue this implementation as soon as I get time it will be me, but in the meantime...
